# Machine Learning Algorithms Showcase
Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms Showcase repository! This project serves as a compilation of implementations for several fundamental machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm has been applied to different datasets, showcasing their versatility and performance across various scenarios.

Algorithms Implemented
Linear Regression: Predictive modeling for linear relationships between input features and target variables.
Multivariate Regression: Extension of linear regression to multiple independent variables.
Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems, predicting the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.
Multiclass Logistic Regression: Extended logistic regression for scenarios with multiple classes.
Decision Trees: Tree-like model used for both classification and regression tasks.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for classification and regression tasks, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to the exciting world of machine learning algorithms! If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
